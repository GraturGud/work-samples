Here you will find several examples of the projects I did during my studies.
Currently there are examples of me working with Postman collections and test runs, list of SQL queries and a few test assignments I've finished.
Right now I'm learning Python and Pytest from scratch, so I'm going to be posting practice files on them for some time...
